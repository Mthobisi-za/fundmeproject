                We are a small team operating remotely, driven by young people. Our startup company is Fast Food Market. We are based in south africa on Gauteng province, soweto. <br> <br> The problem we want to fix is that many small businesses informal
                or formal have both received a decline trend in their sales and lost alot of profit. We want to fix the issue by providing an online system for small fast food shops in soweto to sign up and create a business profile then they can be able
                to list their shop menu online and get customers to order online then customers can collect their item in-store and pay for their item. <br> <br> We need the amount because our resources are limited and the 3rd party services that we want
                to collaborate with require funds, so it is difficult to get started with the project. We need the funds as soon as possible because we have developed the prototype and design of our web application, now we just need to execute the idea
                or development mode. We are going to use the funds by buying and building storage servers that can store data and we going to pay the 3rd party services such as twilio to send sms's to our customers. Please help us save small businesses
                and balance the scale between formal and informal businesses.
                <br> <br> <br>
                <span>Any amount will be appreciated!</span> <span>Thank You</span>
